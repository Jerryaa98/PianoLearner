week 4-5:

At first I added the floor and the background, it took some time because there is many ways to do it,
and each one had a way of view so it took some time to figure which one is the right one to our project.

week 6-7 :

I looked for some appropriate songs, an easy one that could teach begginers how to play on the piano, it took some time, due to that
most of the songs are hard to play, 

week 8-9 :

I fixed the timing of the songs, it was so slow, and added new menu for the chords and progression, I dont have a music background so it took a while, to get how it works.

week 10-11 :
researched how collisions are made, founded a script that will help us how to do it, it took some time to understand it, but at last it was done.
